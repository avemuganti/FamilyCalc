# FamilyCalc

Figures out the correct term for how a person is related to you (i.e. first cousin twice removed, second cousin four times removed, etc.)

Input: a long string made of basic terms of how a person is related to you. Allowed terms: father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter.
Output: the correct, truncated term for how that person is related to you.

  - If you had an Aunt Sally who is your mother's sister, you would type in "mother's sister" and you would receive an output of "aunt".
  - If you had a Great Uncle Herbert who is your father's mother's brother, you would input that string and get an output of "great uncle".
